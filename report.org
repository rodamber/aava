** Part I: Text Searching
*** Introduction
Implemented naive, Knuth-Morris-Pratt and Boyer-Moore algorithms for string
matching. 

*** Tests and Expectations
Naive serves as the control. We test KMP and BM against the naive algorithm.

- Naive: find examples with bad performance.
  - txt: aaaaaab, ptrn: aab
- KMP: relate the # of comparisons to the text size.
- BM: show examples of bad performance (O(n*m))
- BM: relate the # of comparisons to the text size.
- BM: why is it claimed to be sublinear?

** Part II: Connectivity in Forests
*** Introduction
*** Answers to the questions
*** Tests
# For each test, start by creating a linear tree.   
# Use trees with sizes ranging from 1k to 10M.
# Set n = 1M ops for each test.
# We're expecting an n * log(n) curve
