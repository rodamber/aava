* Connectivity in Forests
** Operations
- Link(u,v) : node -> node -> *effect*
- Cut(u,v)  : node -> node -> *effect*
- ConnectedQ(u,v) : node -> node -> bool

They should all be implemented in O(log |V|) by using Link-Cut trees.

** A Data Structure for Dynamic Trees
Each tree of the forest has its edges partitioned into two classes: *solid* and
*broken*.

*Invariant*: At most one of the edges entering each vertex is solid (they assume
the edges are directed from children to parents).

- only allow link(v,w) when v is a tree root
- only allow cut(v,w) when w is the parent of v
- n = |V|, m = |E|

*** Terminology
- apex :: *shallowest* vertex on a solid path
- nadir :: *deepest* vertex on a solid path
- root path :: solid path whose apex is a tree root
  - by def, a rooted tree contains only one root path
- internal path :: solid path that's not a root path
  - by def, a rooted tree may contain zero or noe internal paths

*** Operations
- link(v,w) :: Link the trees containing vertices v and w by adding edge
               (v,w), making vertex w the parent of vertex v. A link is only
               allowed if v and w are in different trees and v is a tree root.

               We carry out link(v,w) by performing expose(w) followed by a type
               1 concatenation of the path whose apex is v and the path whose
               nadir is w.
- cut(v,w) :: Cut the tree containing vertices v and w into two trees by
              deleting edge (v,w). A cut is only allowed if (v,w) is an edge.

              We carry out cut(v,w) by performing expose(v) followed by a
              split(w) of type 1.
- root(v) :: Return the root of the tree containing vertex v.

             We carry out root(v) by performing expose(v) and finding the apex
             of the path containing v.
- evert(v) :: Modify the tree containing vertex v by making v the root.

              We carry out evert(v) by performing expose(v) and then reverse the
              solid path whose nadir is v with reverse(v).

**** Path operations
- concatenate :: Combine paths p1 and p2 into a single path by constructing a
                 solid edge leading from the apex of p1 to the nadir of p2.
  - concatenate1 :: p1 is a root path; the concatenate has the effect of linking
                    the trees containing p1 and p2, carrying out link(apex(p1),
                    nadir(p2)).
  - concatenate2 :: In a type 2 concatenate, p1 and p2 are in the same tree and a
                    broken edge leads from apex(p1) to nadir(p2); the effect of
                    this operation is to convert this broken edge to solid. To
                    specify this op. we only need to give the apex of p1.
- split :: Split the path containing vertex v into two paths, one of which has v
           as its nadir. It's only allowed if a solid edge(u,v) enters vertex v.
  - split1 :: Deletes the edge from the forest.
  - split2 :: Converts the edge to a broken edge.

**** Solid path operations
- splice :: Vertex v must have an exiting broken edge. Let w be the other end of
            the broken edge exiting v. If w has an entering solid edge, perform
            a split(w) of type 2. Once no solid edge enters w, perform a
            concatenate(v) of type 2.
- expose :: Construct a path whose nadir is v and whose apex is the root of the
            tree containing v.
            
            If v has an entering solid edge, perform a split(v) of type 2. Now
            repeat the following step until the apex of the path containing v is
            a tree root: Let w be the apex of the path containing v; perform
            splice(w). 

            _Remark_: Notice that the expose operation requires the ability,
            given a vertex, of finding the apex of the path containing the
            vertex.
- reverse :: reverse the direction of every edge on the path p, thereby
             exchanging the nadir and apex of p.

** Self-Adjusting Binary Search Trees
(Application of splay trees to link/cut trees start in page 26)

*** Splaying
Repeat the splaying step until the accessed node is the root of the tree.
*** Update Operations
- access(i,t) :: If item i is in tree t, return a pointer to its location;
                 otherwise, return a pointer to the null node.

                 To perform access(i,t), we search down from the root of t,
                 looking for i. If the search reaches a node x containing i, we
                 complete the access by splaying at x and returning a pointer to
                 x. If the search reaches the null node, indicating that i is
                 not in the tree, we complete the access by splaying at the last
                 nonnull node reached during the search and returning a pointer
                 to null. If the tree is empty, we omit the splaying operation.
- insert(i,t) :: Insert item i in tree t, assuming that it is not there
                 already.

                 To carry out insert, we perform split(i,t) and then replace t
                 by a tree consisting of a new root node containing i, whose
                 left and right subtrees are the trees t1 and t2 returned by the
                 split.

                 Check the other (better) implementation on page 11.
- delete(i,t) :: Delete item i from tree t, assuming that it is present.

                 To carry out delete(i,t), we perform access(i,t) and then
                 replace t by the join of its left and right subtrees.

                 Check the other (better) implementation on page 11.
- join(t1,t2) :: Combine trees t1 and t2 into a single tree containing all
                 items from both trees and return the resulting tree. This
                 operation assumes that all items in t1 are less than all
                 those in t2 and destroys both t1 and t2.

                 To carry out join(t1,t2), we begin by accessing the largest
                 item, say i, in t1. After the access, the root of t1, contains
                 i and thus has a null right child. We complete the join by
                 making t2 the right subtree of this root and returning the
                 resulting tree. We must deal explicitly with empty input trees.
- split(i,t) :: Construct and return two trees t1 and t2, where t1 contains all
                items in t less than or equal to i, and t2 contains all items in
                t greater than i. This operation destroys t.

                To carry out split(i,t), we perform access(i,t) and then return
                the two trees formed by breaking either the left link or the
                right link from the new root of t, depending on whether the root
                contains an item greater than i or not greater than i. We must
                deal explicitly with the case of an empty input tree.
